# lookbook
ITP 301 Group Project

Created Lookbook with dynamic photos. By using the library turntable.js we are able to create "motion" as hovers over a photo on the horizontal plane (x-axis). We combined the image with the Lighbox plugin so when clicked, a curated photo form that selection is displayed with a description. All the CSS was made from scratch.
